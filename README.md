# Hey! I'm Jorge
Thank you for visiting my Github page! It is currently a work in progress.

I am an AMEL/ASEL Commercial Rated Instrument Pilot and an undergrad from Arizona State University. I created this Github account to learn more about DITA, XML, and other tools used in the creation, management, and publication of documentation. I can be found working on one of the several projects pilot below ⬇️

## Projects
- **DITA Repository**: Learning DITA through mock projects and open-source contributions. 
- **CFI/CFII License:** Working toward becoming a Certified Flight Instructor to build hours and further my knowledge of aviation. 
- **Achieving immortality**: I've almost figured this one out.
- **Learning Python:** Very interested in learning automated process when it comes to documentation as well as other application Python may have.
